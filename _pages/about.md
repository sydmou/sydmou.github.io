I am an assistant professor at MBZUAI and adjunct faculty at Monash Indonesia. I obtained my Ph.D. from the University of Edinburgh’s Institute for Language, Cognition, and Computation, where I focused on enhancing the training and inference speed of machine translation. My studies were supervised by Dr. Kenneth Heafield and Dr. Rico Sennrich. Presently, my research centers around multilingual, low-resource, and low-compute NLP. I have been developing various multilingual large language models, as well as building multilingual NLP resources for underrepresented languages, especially Indonesian. In the past, I have gained industry experience at companies such as Amazon, Google, and Apple.
